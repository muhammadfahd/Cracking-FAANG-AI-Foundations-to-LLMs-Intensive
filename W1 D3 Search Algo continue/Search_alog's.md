# Week 1 ‚Äì Day 3: Search Algorithms in AI
(BFS, DFS, A*, Rule-Based Systems)

## Overview
On **Day 3** of the **AI Foundations Course**, I learned about several fundamental **search algorithms** ‚Äî **BFS**, **DFS (revision)**, **A\***, and **Rule-Based AI Systems**.  
These algorithms are crucial for **problem-solving, pathfinding, and reasoning**, forming the **backbone of AI decision-making**.

## üîç What is Search in AI?
Search in AI is a **systematic process** used by an intelligent agent to **explore possible states** and **find a path to a goal**.  
In simpler terms ‚Äî it‚Äôs how AI systems **think, plan, and decide what to do next**.

### üß© Example
Imagine a **robot in a maze**:
- **Start State** ‚Üí Robot‚Äôs initial position  
- **Actions / Paths** ‚Üí Possible moves it can take  
- **Goal State** ‚Üí The maze‚Äôs exit  

The AI uses **search algorithms** to find a **valid and efficient path** from start to goal.

## üß† Why Search Algorithms Matter in AI
Search algorithms are the **foundation of intelligent behavior**.  
They are essential because they:
- Enable **decision-making** and **goal achievement**.  
- Help AI systems **plan actions** and **navigate environments**.  
- Form the **basis for pathfinding**, **game strategies**, and **robot motion planning**.  
- Bridge the gap between **problem definition** and **solution generation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Search Strategies

### 1Ô∏è. Uninformed (Blind) Search
Uninformed searches **do not have any additional information** about the goal ‚Äî they explore blindly.

#### **Depth First Search (DFS)** ‚Äì Revision
- Explores **deep** paths first before backtracking.  
- Uses a **stack (LIFO)** or recursion.  
- **May not find the shortest path**, but requires **less memory**.  
- Ideal for **deep and narrow** problems.

#### **Breadth First Search (BFS)**
- Explores nodes **level by level**, starting from the root.  
- Uses a **queue (FIFO)** data structure.  
- **Guaranteed to find the shortest path**, but **requires more memory**.  
- Works best for **shallow and wide** search spaces.

##### üß© BFS Example
```python
from collections import deque

def BFS(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node])
```
##### Real-Life Examples of BFS

* Shortest route finding (like in Google Maps or GPS systems)
* Social networks (finding the shortest connection between two users)
* Web crawling (exploring all links level-wise)


### 2. Informed (Heuristic) Search
Informed searches use additional knowledge or heuristics to estimate which path leads faster to the goal.

#### A* (A-Star) Search Algorithm

A* combines:
Actual cost so far (g(n))
Estimated cost to goal (h(n))

Formula:
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

Where:
g(n) = cost from start to current node
h(n) = estimated cost to goal
f(n) = total estimated cost

A* chooses the path with the lowest f(n) value.


##### Importance of A*
* Balances speed (like greedy algorithms) and accuracy (like uniform cost search).
* Ensures the shortest and optimal path if the heuristic is admissible.

##### Real-Life Examples of A*
* Google Maps Navigation ‚Üí Combines real distance (g) and traffic/estimated time (h) to find the best route.
* Robotics Path Planning ‚Üí Robots use A* to navigate obstacles efficiently.
* Game AI Movement ‚Üí NPCs use A* to find optimal paths in game environments.

### 3. Rule-Based AI Systems

Rule-based systems use ‚ÄúIF-THEN‚Äù rules for decision-making and reasoning.
They form one of the earliest forms of symbolic AI and are still widely used.

#### **How They Work**

The system has a knowledge base (rules + facts).
An inference engine applies the rules to infer new information or make decisions.

## Why These Algorithms Are Necessary

These concepts form the core reasoning framework of AI:
üîπ **BFS & DFS** ‚Üí Teach structured exploration.
üîπ **A*** ‚Üí Adds intelligence with heuristics and optimization.
üîπ **Rule-Based Systems** ‚Üí Introduce reasoning, logic, and explainability.

Together, they build the foundation for intelligent agents, decision systems, and autonomous machines.
