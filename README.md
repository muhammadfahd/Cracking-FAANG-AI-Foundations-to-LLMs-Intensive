# Cracking FAANG: AI Foundations to LLMs Journey

Welcome to my learning repository!  
I'm documenting my progress through the **Cracking FAANG: AI Foundations to LLMs Intensive** course.

## 🎯 Goal
To understand and implement key concepts from Artificial Intelligence to Large Language Models (LLMs) — from mathematical foundations to hands-on coding.

## Folder Structure
Each folder represents a topic or day:
- **Notes** → my learnings and explanations  
- **Notebooks** → hands-on implementations  
- **Reflections** → what I learned and how it connects to real-world AI

## Daily Progress
Check [`progress_log.md`](./progress.md) for my day-by-day updates.
