##  What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the ability of a machine to perform tasks that are typically associated with **human intelligence**, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and perception.

## 🧠 Categories of AI

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)** | Systems specialized for a single specific task. | Spam filters, recommendation systems |
| **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** | Capable of understanding and solving problems across multiple domains. | Still theoretical |
| **ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)** | A speculative form of intelligence surpassing human cognitive abilities. | Future concept, seen in sci-fi |

## Domains & Applications of AI
![alt text](domain_of_ai.png)
AI powers several key domains and technologies that shape real-world innovation.

### 1️. Computer Vision
**Definition:** Enables machines to extract and interpret meaningful information from images and videos.  
**Common Tasks:** Classification, Detection, Segmentation, Tracking  
**Applications:** Medical imaging, OCR (Optical Character Recognition)  
**Techniques:** CNNs, Transfer Learning, Object Detection  

### 2️. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
**Definition:** Enables computers to understand, generate, and interact using human language.  
**Applications:** Chatbots, Machine Translation, Summarization, Information Retrieval, Sentiment Analysis  
**Core Techniques:** Tokenization, Embeddings, Transformers (BERT, GPT)  

### 3️. Robotics
**Definition:** Integrates hardware and AI for perception, planning, control, and interaction.  
**Applications:** Industrial automation, Mobile robots, Surgical robots  
**Key Topics:** Kinematics, Dynamics, Motion Planning, Control, Sensors & Actuators
